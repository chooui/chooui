Hey I'm chooui I've always wanted to compete at a LAN for CS:GO but was never old enough, now I'm nearly 21 and I'm really enjoying Valorant.
I'm combining everything I've learnt from gaming all over the years to hopefully compete in high Tier 3 and see if i'm good enough to break into Tier 2!
This Github is just a place where I'll put the links to resources I've used and combinations of playlists for the aim trainer Kovaaks!
